{"name":"Wp-init","tagline":"Simple Node.js script that initializes a WordPress install","body":"#This is a work in progress 0.0.1-alpha\r\n\r\nIt is a simple Node.js module that helps initializing WordPress more information to come. For the time being I would suggest you don't use it. If you think it will solve you issue please contact me at [dtholloran@gmail.com](dtholloran@gmail.com) I can help get you up and running.\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n- Node.js [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)\r\n- WP CLI [http://wp-cli.org/](http://wp-cli.org/)\r\n- Grunt.js CLI [http://gruntjs.com/](http://gruntjs.com/) *(optional)*\r\n\r\n###Installation(For now I may add to NPM IDK)\r\n- Clone repo to a /bin, your home directory, or some where else you wan't to keep it.\r\n- If you want to use the `wp-init` command add  `alias wp-init=\"node /path/to/wp-init.js\"` to .zshrc, .bashrc, etc. if not just execute `node /path/to/wp-init.js`\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\n- In a terminal run `cd path/to/install/wordpress`\r\n- Then run `wp-init`\r\n- Follow all prompts.\r\n\r\n###Options\r\n- `--debug`: Allows for using the options in ./debug-options.js, probably not very useful for anyone but me.\r\n- `--options`: With no parameters it will create a file wp-init-custom-options.js in your current working directory.\r\n- `--options=/full/path/to/wp-init-custom-options.js`: Allows using a custom options file, please run `wp-init --options` first since you will ned a base to start from. **For the time being you should redo everything after updating in case an option has changed probably will be an addition not a removal**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
